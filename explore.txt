[GUARD HOUSE]

You found the key for the Chemistry Lab.

You found a confiscated EMF detector. The log states that the device was confiscated last Friday after a student collapsed after the the device was turned on. You wonder why a student would bring one to school.

As you skim across the files, you saw a newspaper stained with coffee. It seems to be the the highschool student paper "UP Bamtuli". You scanned the paper and saw a news article that piqued your interest:

Acacia Tree Inexplicably Falls Down

UP HIGH SCHOOL CEBU - large acacia tree falls downnear the UPHS guard
house last Friday at 8pm. 

The tree, which reportedly stood for over 60 years, fell unexpectedly
during a class reconciliation last week. No one was injured during this
incident.

Eye witnesses from the faculty room notice a figure wearing a white dress
approaching the tree. Upon inspection, the UP CMO concluded the cause to
be a gradual weakening of the trunk due to strong wind safter Typhoon
Odette. The fallen tree was removed shortly after to make space for a new
parking area near the guard house.

You found a bike pump. You looked at the poster saying "NO to bomb jokes" and thought about the owner of the pump.
You found a half empty "Mon Dacchiatto" coffee cup. It still feels cold.
You found a dog collar with the name "Bambam". You also saw a photo of the dog on the guard's table.
You read through the logbook. It seems like one student keeps on appearing on every account, but their name is always redacted.
You found a safe. This may or may not be a red herring.

[MUSIC ROOM]

You found a medkit.

You found a chinese mirror. The center looks like it has been used before but failed. You remember that this item can dispell lesser spirits.

You found a red clearbook labelled "REL-ENG5"  with every single page being blank apart from one. As you open it, it seems to be a personal copy of a handwritten piece of music with a few notes:

                      "WHAT SHE PLAYS"  

         ___|\________________________________________
        |___|/_____________________________(___)______|
        |__/|____4____________________________________|
        |_(_/^\__4_________________(   )______________|
        |__\|/'_________(___)_________________________|
            d    (   )
            

My students keep telling me the piano plays on its own every night.
They also say they see a japanese child on the mirrors. As a devout
Catholic, I have never believed on the stories they've told me. That
was until I heard the faint sound of the piano. Although all its keys
were faulty, it seemed to play an unearthly melody. There was no one
there, but I know something was there.

I transcribed the melody quickly on a piece of sheet music I took. This
melody keeps on repeating and it makes me insane. I already tried those
Chinese superstitions that are said to dispell spirits but it only seemed
to anger her even more. The melody somehow soothes her only when she appears.

You found a piece titled "Forty and One". Its author is not written on the sheet music.
You found clearbooks with some of them looking as old as the school itself.
You found a bag of certificates. You wonder how much the choir practiced for these performances.
You found the keyboard used for practices. Its bag is now reduced down to a rag with a zipper attached.
You found a guitar with 3 strings. The strings are somehow all tuned to C.

[FACULTY ROOM]

You found your bag.

You found a medkit.

You found the clerk's faculty records. However, a portion of it seems to be scorched.
You read what remained in the records and saw that the date of the record is 1971, which is 54 years ago

You found a class list for the Batch 2017-2023. Forty students enrolled, however every attendance check seems to have an extra redacted name.
You found a large black and white painting of what seems to be a distorted face. A rosary is placed on the frame with a note reading "DO NOT TOUCH".
You found test scores for a chemistry exam. One student scored 88/760 in a 50 item test for some reason.
You found a confiscated condom inside a sock, which seems weird as condoms aren't prohibited in the highschool.
You found a set of dried markers. You took a massive sniff, smelling the ink.

[CHEMISTRY LAB]

You found the key for the Senior High building.

You found a vial of water being labelled as "Holy Water". Beside it is the vial named "Cat Urine".

You found a laboratory record from a lab report. It seems like groups of students enter the room together.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Results:

The experiment yielded no conclusive results, as there are multiple external factors
affecting the observation of the holy water specimen. Moreover, one of the researchers
is documented to have extreme allergic reactions when in contact with the pyrite set.

Remarks:
- Unknown interference affecting lenses and equipment; lens seeing double
- Molarity of compounds double when unobserved
- Specimen labelled "Gold" misidentified

You found a vial labelled "Tetraphosphorus Pentoxide". Behind it is the balanced equation for P4O10.
You found a copy of the periodic table. Niobium is suspiciously cut off.
You found magnesium strips. Bored, you lit one on fire and immediately got flashbanged.
You found a couple of vials labelled as different mythological items. Upon further inspection, those were stool samples.
You found two clumps of powder and mixed them together. Congratulations, you just created a war crime.
